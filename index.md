DevOps is a set of practices and philosophies that focus on improving collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams. It is not a title or a specific role that an individual can hold. Instead, it is a way of working and a culture that emphasizes the importance of collaboration and the integration of development and operations activities.

In a DevOps environment, developers and IT operations professionals work closely together to develop, test, and deploy software. They share responsibility for the quality, security, and performance of the software and work together to continuously improve the software delivery process.

Because DevOps is a way of working rather than a specific role or title, individuals who are part of a DevOps team may have a variety of job titles, such as developer, IT operations engineer, or system administrator. The key is that they work together as a team to achieve common goals, rather than operating in silos.
