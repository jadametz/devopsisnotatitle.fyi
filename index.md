DevOps is not typically a job title, but rather a set of practices and principles that focus
on collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations
professionals. The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and reliability of software
development and deployment, and to make it easier for organizations to deliver high-
quality software quickly and efficiently. While some organizations may have a specific role
called "DevOps Engineer," this is not the norm, and most software development teams
adopt DevOps principles as part of their overall approach to software development.
